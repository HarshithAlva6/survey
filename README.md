Form Builder App -

An app that allows physicians to build, manage, and distribute custom surveys for patients.

1.	Form Builder Interface: 
Built using React front-end framework with a simple drag-and-drop interface (react-dnd)
Physicians should be able to create custom surveys with multiple types of fields, such as -
a. Multiple choice questions
b. Short answer fields
c. Rating scales (e.g., 1-5)
d. Forms should allow setting required fields.
e. Physicians can save, edit, and delete these custom surveys.

2.	Survey Assignment: 
Need API endpoints to save and retrieve survey forms and responses, built using node and Express.js.
Physicians should be able to assign a survey to a specific patient
The assigned survey should appear under the patient's login page for them to work on it.

3.	Survey Data Collection:
Create and use a database schema under MongoDB Atlas that supports the dynamic nature of surveys and their responses.
Once patients complete the survey, their responses should be stored and accessible to the physician. This is handled in the same page where the surveys can be assigned.

Assessment Focus:

•	UI/UX design skills for creating a form builder.
•	Ability to structure dynamic forms and handle multiple input types.
•	Front-end and back-end integration for saving and managing custom survey data.
